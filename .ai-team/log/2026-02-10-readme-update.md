# Session: 2026-02-10-readme-update

**Requested by:** Shayne Boyer

## What Happened

- Verbal updated README.md — replaced default create-next-app boilerplate with comprehensive SlideМaker documentation covering features, tech stack, prerequisites, setup, usage, API reference, development commands, and project structure.
- PR #31 opened, reviewed, squash-merged to master.

## Decisions Captured

1. **No secrets in GitHub content** — never include tokens, API keys, or credentials in issues, PRs, commits, or repo content. Use env vars or secret managers only.
2. **Always update docs, tests, and agents.md with changes** — no change ships without corresponding documentation and test updates.

## Directives

- Both decisions logged as directives by Shayne Boyer.
- Propagated to all agent history files.
