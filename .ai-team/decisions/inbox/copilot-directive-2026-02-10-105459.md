### 2026-02-10: Always update docs, tests, and agents.md with changes
**By:** Shayne Boyer (via Copilot)
**What:** When making changes or additions to the codebase, always update related documentation (README, inline docs), tests, and agents.md. No change ships without corresponding doc/test updates.
**Why:** User directive — ensures the project stays well-documented and tested as it evolves.
