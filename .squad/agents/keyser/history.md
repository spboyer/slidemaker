### 2025-07-22 — PRD Decomposition
- Decomposed PRD.md into 9 GitHub issues (US-1 through US-9), issues #1–#9
- Created squad labels: `squad`, `squad:mcmanus`, `squad:verbal`, `squad:fenster`, `squad:keyser`
- Assigned 6 frontend stories to Verbal, 2 backend API stories to McManus, 1 test story to Fenster
- Established dependency graph: US-7 (#8) and US-8 (#7) are the foundational APIs with no deps; most frontend stories depend on them
- Note on issue numbering: US-7 mapped to #8 and US-8 mapped to #7 due to parallel creation — dependency comments reference correct issue numbers
- Added dependency comments to issues #1, #3, #4, #5, #6, #9
- US-2 (#2) and the two backend APIs (#7, #8) can start immediately in parallel
- Decision recorded in `.ai-team/decisions/inbox/keyser-prd-decomposition.md`
