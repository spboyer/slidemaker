      "notes": "Spend ~30 seconds per bullet. Mention how static typing helps developers catch errors during development. Highlight IntelliSense as a key productivity booster. Discuss the seamless compatibility with JavaScript, making it easy to adopt. Wrap up with type inference, emphasizing how TypeScript balances strict typing with ease of use.",

Spend ~2 minutes explaining each section: (1) Variable type annotations, (2) Function parameter and return types, (3) Interfaces for defining object shapes. Pause for questions after explaining interfaces. Transition: 'Now that we’ve seen the basics, let’s look at how TypeScript fits into larger projects.'",
