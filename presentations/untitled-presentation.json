      "notes": "Welcome everyone to this session on TypeScript Basics. We'll explore how TypeScript enhances JavaScript with strong typing and better tooling. This is a 10-minute session aimed at developers who are familiar with JavaScript but new to TypeScript. Quick show of hands: how many of you have used TypeScript before?",

      "notes": "Spend about 2 minutes on this slide. Explain that TypeScript is still JavaScript at its core, but with extra features like static typing. Highlight that it helps catch errors early during development and improves the developer experience. Use examples like better code completion and refactoring support in IDEs.

      "notes": "Take 3 minutes to walk through this code. Start with the type annotation for variables — it's simple but powerful for catching errors. Then move to function typing: explain how defining parameter and return types makes the code more predictable and self-documenting. Finally, touch on interfaces for defining object shapes. Encourage the audience to ask questions if they're new to these concepts.",

      "notes": "Spend about 2 minutes here. Go row by row: Static Typing helps reduce runtime errors — give an example of catching a type mismatch before deployment.

      "notes": "Wrap up the session with a 2-minute overview of why TypeScript matters. Emphasize fewer bugs leading to happier users and how static typing provides a shared understanding across the team. Mention that TypeScript scales well even for enterprise-level applications and can be gradually adopted in existing JavaScript projects. End by thanking the audience and inviting questions.",
