      "notes": "Welcome the audience to the presentation. Introduce yourself and share the goal of the session: to provide a foundational understanding of TypeScript. Mention the target audience: developers with basic JavaScript knowledge. Spend 1-2 minutes setting the stage for the talk.",

      "notes": "Start with the basics: explain that TypeScript builds on JavaScript. Highlight static typing as its key feature—this helps catch errors early. Mention that it's widely adopted and backed by Microsoft. Spend about 2 minutes here.",

      "notes": "Focus on the benefits of TypeScript that resonate with your audience. Discuss how static typing leads to fewer runtime errors and better collaboration in teams. Highlight modern IDE support for TypeScript, which makes development faster and more efficient. Ask the audience: 'Who here has struggled with a bug that could have been caught by TypeScript?'",

      "notes": "Walk through the code step by step. First, explain what an interface is and how it defines the shape of an object. Then, show how the function uses the 'User' type, ensuring that 'name' is a string and 'age' is a number. Highlight how this helps catch errors during development. Spend around 3 minutes here.",

      "notes": "Summarize the key points of the presentation. Reinforce the benefits of TypeScript and encourage the audience to try it out. Suggest starting with a small project or converting a single JavaScript file to TypeScript. End with a call to action: 'Give it a shot!'
